## Frontend interface to Retrogaming, inspired in Steam Big Picture Mode and Kart Project
The idea behind is to create a react interface + electron to launch games with RetroArch and have media options like Netflix and Youtube. When installed soon as the operation system boots, the interface enter in full-screen mode.
